# Initial Configuration

Each developer kit will require initial setup steps before proceeding to Sage configuration steps. These device-specific guides include initial setup tasks that are similar to the getting started steps for any new computer, and installing updates for the operating system and associated software. Follow the linked getting started guides for your developer kit:   

**In order to complete the initial configuration steps, you will need:**

• Internet access (ethernet or wireless)   
• Monitor with cable to connect to the developer kit (check the specific setup guide for more details)    
• Keyboard and mouse   

**The setup guides will include steps such as:**

• Review/accept the manufacturer's software EULA    
• Select a system language, your prefered keyboard layout, and the time zone    
• A prompt to name the computer   
• Prompts to create a username and password    
• Configure ethernet or wireless networking
