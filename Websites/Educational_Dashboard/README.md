# Educational Dahsboard Website

The purpose of this website is to provide an interactive learning environment where students can experiment with code and gain hands-on experience in data visualization.


The **Educational Dashboard** is developed using HTML and CSS, with JavaScript snippets integrated to display results generated by the Directional AI system. Its main goal is to present left and right counter data collected by the AI which allows us to discover foot patterns. Additionally, it provides a monthly overview, including total foot traffic and CPU/GPU temperature, memory usage, and other performance metrics, through custom programming. You are able to view the data by week or by month. 

**Key Features:**
- Real-time display of directional foot traffic data.
- Monthly summaries with aggregated statistics.
- Customizable data retrieval for system metrics.
- Responsive design for different devices.

**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Data Source:** Data is being collected from a Nvidia Jetson Developer Kit which is set up to follow the Directional AI structure. The data is then stored in a server where we can use an API to access it.
