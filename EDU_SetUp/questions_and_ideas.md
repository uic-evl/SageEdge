**Essential Questions**

• How can we measure phenomena like temperature, the motion of living things, noise, and air quality?

• What is artificial intelligence (AI)?

• How can we use AI in a way that is helpful to humans but does not endanger the privacy of those humans?

• What can we do with the data we gather, and how do those data sources relate to each other?

• What is the difference between Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and closed (or proprietary) source software? What are the benefits to using FOSS?


**Big Ideas**

• We can measure many aspects of daily life, including natural phenomena like temperature, as well as human behaviors like traffic patterns in school hallways.

• The data we gather from measuring phenomena and behaviors can help us understand more complex systems.  

• Artificial Intelligence (AI), a computing technology that can be thought of as machine intelligence, can be used in ways that benefit all living things and protect basic rights such as privacy and anonymity.

• If we create and use open source software, we can share it with other humans. This enables natural collaboration and helps others understand what we are doing. It also means that many individuals and groups can work on the same ideas, but approach problem solving and ideation in unique ways that can yield new results in a manner not always possible with proprietary software.
