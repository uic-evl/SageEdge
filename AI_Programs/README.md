# AI Programs
This AI programs folder hosts the different AI projects worked on specifically for Nvidia Jetson Orins.

- Movement Tracking: This is an object detection project that uses YOLOv8 and DeepSORT to track people's movement and create data from their left/right movement.

- Weather Detection: This is a program that looks at images from the NIU database and detects the weather type of said image. **(TODO)**
